# Employee Absenteeism Analysis – HR Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project explores patterns of employee absenteeism within a workplace setting. Based on 740 absence records from 36 employees, it aims to identify behavioral trends, risk factors, and actionable insights for human resources teams seeking to improve attendance and reduce productivity loss.

## Objectives
- Understand which employee profiles have the highest absenteeism rates.
- Analyze the impact of personal, lifestyle, and logistical variables on absences.
- Detect patterns by season, weekday, and arrival time.
- Deliver an executive summary and visual dashboards for strategic decision-making.

## Dataset
- Original dataset: `Absenteeism_at_work.xlsx`
- 740 records covering:
  - 36 employees
  - Number of absences
  - Total hours missed
  - Personal attributes (children, education, smoker)
  - Logistical data (commute distance, transport cost)
  - Temporal data (month, weekday, arrival time)

## Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **BigQuery** (SQL for transformation)
- **Tableau** (Interactive visualizations)
- **Excel** (Initial exploration and validation)

## Key Insights
- 77.8% of employees had at least one absence.
- The average number of absences per affected employee was 26.43.
- Employees with three children showed the highest average absenteeism (12.2 hours).
- Absences peaked in July, on Mondays, and for those arriving at 10 AM.
- The oldest employees (age 58) had unusually high missed hours.
- Lifestyle and logistics had mixed effects, but stress periods and work schedules showed clear influence.
